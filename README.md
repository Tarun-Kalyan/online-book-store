The Online Book Store is a Java-based project that allows users to browse, purchase, and manage books efficiently. The project offers four main features:

1. Browse & Buy Books – Users can explore a variety of books and make purchases.
2. Add to Cart – Selected books can be added to a shopping cart for checkout.
3. View Purchase History – Users can review their past purchases.
4. Exit & Reset Stock – Upon exiting, the bookstore resets the inventory to its original stock.

The system keeps track of available book stock and updates it dynamically after each purchase. A bill is generated after each purchase and once the user exits, the bookstore automatically resets to its default inventory.
